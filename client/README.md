# Scope UI

## Getting Started

- Setup: `npm install`
- Build: `gulp build --release`, output will be in `build/`
- Develop: `gulp sync` and then open `http://localhost:3000/`

To see a topology, `../app/app` needs to be running, as well as a probe.

## Coding

This directory has a `.eslintrc`, make sure your editor supports linter hints.
To run a linter, you also run `gulp lint`.
